project 2:

In this I've made a two project based on turtle.
these are added into project 2.zip file

1.In this project I've created a turtle that takes input from user by using keyboard keys like w for forward and s for backward etc...

2.In this project I've made a race of turtles.
Firstly we have to select a color turtle from some turtles,then the race begins.if the turtle selected by you reaches the end at first then it will say that you have won otherwise you have lost.
